### What I learned

This was my first ever full stack project. I enjoyed developing this app in the Rapid Application Development environment provided by .NET platform. I learned a lot of new things such as database connectivity and got a general understanding of the backend of a management system.

### Continued development

Currently, reports are generted only on Visual Studio 2019. I'd like to work on this and generate consistent reports across all platforms.
